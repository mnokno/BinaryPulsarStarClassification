# BinaryPulsarStarClassification
Binary classification of start as pulsar or non- pulsar based on observation results using CatBoost, XGBoost and LGBM.

Features taken into consideration:
- Mean_Integrated: Mean of Observations.
- SD: Standard deviation of Observations.
- EK: Excess kurtosis of Observations.
- Skewness: In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. Skewness of Observations.
- Mean_DMSNR_Curve: Mean of DM SNR CURVE of Observations.
- SD_DMSNR_Curve: Standard deviation of DM SNR CURVE of Observations.
- EK_DMSNR_Curve: Excess kurtosis of DM SNR CURVE of Observations.
- Skewness_DMSNR_Curve: Skewness of DM SNR CURVE of Observations
